# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# This section is for the datasheet/website. Use descriptive names (e.g., RX, TX, MOSI, SCL, SEG_A, etc.).
pinout:
  # Inputs
  ui[0]: "SER_L"          # Serial input for left shift
  ui[1]: "SER_R"          # Serial input for right shift
  ui[2]: "MODE0"          # Mode select bit 0
  ui[3]: "MODE1"          # Mode select bit 1
  ui[4]: "PAR_LOAD"       # Parallel load enable (1 = load, 0 = shift/hold)
  ui[5]: "CLR"            # Asynchronous clear/reset (active high)
  ui[6]: "CLK_EN"         # Clock enable for shifting/loading
